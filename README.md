# Traffic Light Management Multi-Agent System (MAS)

This repository contains a **Java Gradle project** implementing a **traffic-light management system** using a multi-agent approach. It models and simulates how traffic lights at intersections operate and interact to improve traffic flow.

---

## Overview

Traffic management is a fundamental problem in modern urban environments. This project applies principles from **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** to create autonomous and cooperative traffic-light agents that can:

- Manage intersection states
- Coordinate with other agents
- Simulate traffic control scenarios

The system demonstrates how MAS methodologies can be applied to real-world coordination problems.

## Requirements

You need:

- **Java JDK 8 or higher**
- **No manual Gradle installation needed** — the project includes the Gradle Wrapper.
